                <h2>What is it about?</h2>
                <p>Coraline moves with her parents to an old apartment house out near the woods. Her parents are always busy with work, work, work and there is no one of the same age around the place to socialize with. So she goes exploring. While exploring, she meets the senile seeming old neighbors and finds a locked door in an abandoned room. Seeing as how the locked door looked more interesting, she finds the key, unlocks it and ends up in a strange world, where everyone's eyes are replaced with buttons. It looks like the funnest place to be... but is it really?</p>
